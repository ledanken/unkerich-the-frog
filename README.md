# Unkerich: The friendly frog website (PP1)

Here is the link to [Unkerich: the friendly frog]() website. 
<br><br>
This is a Website about frogs and owned by a frog, whose name is Unkerich. This is designed to be an informative website about all frogs.

### How I did this website?

I started by preparing the images I wanted to put in it. Two images I got - one to be a background image for the body element which I got for free from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com), but I am not able to use it. The Logo, which is the picture of Unkerich is uniquely taken by our own camera and I worked on it pixel sizes through the use of the open-source [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org).
