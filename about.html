        <h3>UNKERICH´S LIFE STORY</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The kind frog who inspired this website came into our life as a children´s toy. After he had acquired human speech
        capabilitis, he narrated the story of his long and eventful life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Unkerich´s early youth was spent in a rainwater barrel in the lower highlands of Kilimanjaro mountain in Tanzania, he
        hasn´t a clear memory of this period, though.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He continues to speak in person from here on:</p>
        <br>
        <p>My school years in the public school for small amphibians and tiny mammals in the cozy little town of Arusha soon
        brought me to a keen understanding of natural sciences, later on also of anthropology. I went to study human sciences
        and virology in Stone Town Univerity, Zanzibar.</p>
