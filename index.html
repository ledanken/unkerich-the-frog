        <h2>Facts & Features</h2>
        <h3>What is the difference between toads an frogs?</h3>
        <p>Frogs have long legs, longer than their head and body. The legs of frogs are made for hopping. Toads have much shorter
        legs and they find it nicer to crawl around. Toads have a dry, warty skin, which comes mostly in greyish or yellowish
        colour. Frogs are mostly considered green, but certain frog species feature colours including red, blue and yellow, even
        purple or black. Some wear dresses in mixed colours.
        </p>
